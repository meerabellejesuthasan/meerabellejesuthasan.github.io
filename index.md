I am a journalist and fact-checker based in Marseille, France. Currently, I'm a fact-checker at [Rest of World](https://restofworld.org/). 

My reporting focuses largely on politics and social movements in [US](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/philadelphia-dem-primary-movement/), [French](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/france-global-security-law/), and Singaporean contexts. I'm particularly interested in covering subjects that intersect with immigration and working conditions with an international angle. Recently, I wrote about the [fight against the death penalty in Singapore](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/singapore-death-penalty/) and the [insensitive therapy bot provided to stressed-out Singaporean teachers](https://restofworld.org/2022/free-therapy-chatbots-singapore/). I've also covered [climate change](https://newnaratif.com/singapores-migrant-labour-climate-crisis-conundrum/), and [queer history](https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/information-activism-review/).

I was trained as a fact-checker in 2020 at The Nation, and then went on to oversee fact-checking as coordinator at The Intercept. Today I'm mostly working at Rest of World, and have also checked articles and podcasts for [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/), [Coda Story](https://www.codastory.com/), the [Global Investigative Journalism Network](https://gijn.org/), and [TED](https://www.ted.com/). I've also fact-checked books, including Jay Caspian Kang's [The Loneliest Americans](https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/searching-for-coherence-in-asian-america).

A noter : Je suis bilingue en français, et j'ai un niveau avancé d'espagnol.
