My work has appeared in The Nation, New Naratif, IJNet, and others. I write about and research climate change, oral history, archives, language and language access, theatre, (post-)colonialism, and leftist organizing around the world. I am also an experienced fact-checker and copy-editor. I am currently based in France.
