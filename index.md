I am a journalist and fact-checker currently based in Marseille, France. Currently, I am the fact-check coordinator over at [The Intercept](http://theintercept.com/).

Most recently, I completed a year-long internship at [The Nation](https://thenation.com), where I fact-checked articles for print and web in every section of the magazine. My work has appeared in The Nation, New Naratif, Study Hall, and others. I am drawn to stories about climate change, history, activism, and theatre. My writing includes [features](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/philadelphia-dem-primary-movement/), [explainers](https://newnaratif.com/research/explainer-the-climate-crisis-and-singapore/), [reviews](https://www.broadstreetreview.com/theater/inis-nua-theatre-company-presents-inua-ellamss-untitled), [lesson plans](https://pulitzercenter.org/builder/lesson/using-oral-history-reporting-26959), and [blog posts](https://pulitzercenter.org/blog/pulitzer-center-brings-circus-without-borders-filmmakers-and-acrobats-dc-schools). I've also done [research]({{site.baseurl}}/#researching), translation, and [social media]({{site.baseurl}}/#social-media) work, as well as [fact-checking]({{site.baseurl}}/#fact-checking) and copy editing. I'm a native French speaker and capable in Spanish.

Je suis journaliste basée à Marseille, France. Mes articles (principalement en anglais) ont paru dans The Nation, New Naratif, IJNet, et d'autres encore. J'écris sur les thèmes du changement climatique, l'histoire, l'activisme, et le théâtre. Je parle couramment le français, et j'ai un niveau avancé d'espagnol.
