Hi, I'm Meerabelle, a writer, researcher, and copyeditor (or copy editor, if we're talking AP style). I'm also involved in theatre and music, specifically producing, directing, and designing for shows. In May 2019, I'll have graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, and I'd really love a job—in fact, I imagine I'd be great at one! Some of my strengths include:

* Journalistic reporting

* Research and fact-checking

* Copyediting

* Creative writing

How to Write About Palestine | ExtraNewsfeed
If you visit Palestine you will not find one conflict, or two. You will not find one land, or two. You will not find two same opinions. You will not get straightforward answers from the mouths of those who have suffered everything you came here to witness firsthand. When asking them what should be done to solve this thing, they will not fold their life up into a diplomatic solution for you.

The Other Wharton Graduate | The Daily Pennsylvanian
Exorbitant lifestyle. Infamous interviews. A wealthy family who funded his debut as an entrepreneur. Portly, frequently-mocked physique. Lavish habits that are as fascinating as they are shameful to an entire country’s politics. And a Wharton graduate. Sound familiar?

He’s not Donald Trump, but Malaysian tycoon Jho Low comes pretty close.

I have done reading and research for writers including fiction writer Carmen Maria Machado and playwright Huzir Sulaiman, providing them with extensive notes and reading lists on themes including French interwar history and humanitarian aid organizations.
