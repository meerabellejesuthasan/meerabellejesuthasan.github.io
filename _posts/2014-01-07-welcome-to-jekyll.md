Hi, I'm Meerabelle, a writer, researcher, and copyeditor (or copy editor, if we're talking AP style). I'm also involved in theatre and music, specifically producing, directing, and designing for shows. In May 2019, I'll have graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, and I'd really love a job—in fact, I imagine I'd be great at one! Some of my strengths include:

Journalistic reporting

Research and fact-checking

Copyediting

Creative writing

PS – Je viens en mode bilingue, français courant inclus!

PPS – Y hablo el español un poco también.

PPPS – என்னுடைய தமிர் கெட்ட...
