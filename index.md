<h1 id="faq"> FAQ </h1>

<h2>"What did you actually study?"</h2>
My BA is in History with a World History Concentration, meaning I mostly studied non-Western history with a focus on colonialism and decolonization. I wrote an award-winning Honors thesis on the development of international anti-imperialism in Paris between the World Wars. In addition, I have a minor in Creative Writing and a minor in Cognitive Science with a concentration in Language and Mind.

<h2>"You speak French? How much French do you speak?"</h2>
A lot. I am a French passport holder and a native speaker, able to converse and navigate the culture. I speak French at home and have a bilingual IB diploma from high school, meaning I took literature in both English and French. I also studied Spanish at an advanced level in college.
