I made graphics and captions for [Checkpoint Theatre's](instagram.com/checkpointtheatre) instagram page during my internship with them in summer 2018. In particular, I helped create posts for the #CheckpointinTime series, which looked back at previous productions. I also wrote copy for audition calls and Facebook posts.

I made graphics for [The Philadelphia Citizen](instagram.com/thephiladelphiacitizen) during my internship with them in fall 2018. I made graphics throughout the day during The Citizen's first Ideas We Should Steal Festival.
